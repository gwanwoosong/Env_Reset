We present a cost-effective pretraining paradigm for VLA models using only synthetic data, achieving direct sim-to-real transfer and strong zero-shot generalizability for robotic grasping. Key contributions include:

- **SynGrasp-1B**: a billion-frame synthetic grasping dataset, spanning 240 object categories and 10,000+ objects.

- **GraspVLA**: a VLA model pretrained on SynGrasp-1B that achieves zero-shot generalization to real-world grasping without fine-tuning.

- **Unified CoT Framework**: GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception and flow-matching-based action generation into a single reasoning process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and internet-scale semantic data for open-vocabulary grasping.

- [2025-07-19] Release the [supplementary material](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03233).

## Model Server

Please follow the steps below to start the model server. We provide the checkpoint of GraspVLA on both [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/shengliangd/GraspVLA) and [Baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DOJbKrKzdBcEIrFQ_NcuLw?pwd=6666). GraspVLA achieves 200ms inference latency using ~9GB of GPU memory when running on a single NVIDIA RTX L40s GPU.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKU-EPIC/GraspVLA
cd GraspVLA
```

### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment
Create and activate a conda environment with the required dependencies, for example:
```bash
conda create -n GraspVLA python=3.9.19
conda activate GraspVLA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Model Weights

If you want to download from huggingface:
```
pip install -U "huggingface_hub"
# set HF_ENDPOINT if you encounter connection issues:
# export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
hf download shengliangd/GraspVLA
```
The model weight will be placed at `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--shengliangd--GraspVLA/snapshots/f291eac1d3494c5c13c3d420af4e5bc987f23c3e/checkpoint/model.safetensors`.

### Step 4: Launch the Model Server
Run the model server with your desired configuration, for example:
```bash
python3 -u -m vla_network.scripts.serve --path you-path-to-model.safetensors --port 6666
```

#### Required arguments:

- --path — Path to the model.safetensors file.

- --port — Port number on which the server will listen for incoming requests.

#### Optional arguments:

- --compile: Enable model compilation (default: False). Speeds up inference (500ms → 200ms) but adds ~3 minutes to startup time. Recommended for large-scale evaluations (e.g., LIBERO benchmark).

Success: The message `Started server on port <PORT>` indicates the server is ready.

### Offline Test And Visualization

To quickly test GraspVLA without setting up a simulation or real-world environment, use the `offline_test` script. It runs offline inference on pre-recorded requests and compares results. The script saves a comparison image in `visualization`, with our reference output (left) and your model’s output (from the specified port) on the right.

```bash
python3 -u -m vla_network.scripts.offline_test --port <PORT>
```

### Repository Structure

High-level overview of `vla_network` file-tree:

+ `config/` - Contains basic configurations for our model.
+ `data_preprocessing/` - Includes tools for preprocessing raw data into model-ready formats.
+ `model/` - Code for defining and loading the main model structure.
+ `scripts/` - Contains the `serve.py` file that starts a model server and the `offline_test.py` file that performs offline visualization.
+ `type/` - Data type definitions used in our model.
+ `utils/` - Contains some constants used in our model.

## Simulation Playground
We provide a simulation playground for GraspVLA here: [GraspVLA-playground](https://github.com/MiYanDoris/GraspVLA-playground). This repository includes both the evaluation code used for GraspVLA in the [LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO) benchmark and an enhanced playground environment built on top of it. The playground provides an easy-to-use interface to evaluate GraspVLA across diverse objects, layouts, and environments.

## Real World Control Interface
We provide a [real-world control interface](https://github.com/MiYanDoris/GraspVLA-real-world-controller) for deploying GraspVLA in physical environments. This interface enables:

- Zero-shot evaluation on real-world objects.

- Both blocking and non-blocking control modes.

- Real-time visualization of intermediate COT results, including 2D bounding boxes and 3D grasp poses.
